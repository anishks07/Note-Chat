## Technical Workflow Behind the Scenes

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **File Upload**: PDFs are received via the FastAPI backend
2. **Text Extraction**: Content is extracted from PDF files
3. **Text Chunking**: Documents are split into semantic chunks
4. **Vectorization**: Text chunks are converted to embeddings
5. **Storage**: Vectors are stored in FAISS for similarity search

### Question Answering Process
1. **Query Processing**: User questions are analyzed and vectorized
2. **Similarity Search**: Relevant document chunks are retrieved
3. **Context Building**: Retrieved chunks provide context for the LLM
4. **Response Generation**: AI generates answers based on document content
5. **History Tracking**: Conversation context is maintained
